# Flask Demo Application
This is a simple Flask app meant to be used as a starter structure for other projects.

# Running it on the terminal
## For Linux and Mac:
```
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```
## For Windows cmd, use set instead of export:
```
> set FLASK_APP=app.py
> set FLASK_ENV=development
> flask run
```
